# Track-a-Lot Plugin

This is a tracker plugin for Obsidian (https://obsidian.md).

It scrapes different webpages, builds lists with the items, and allows you to
individually track their status.

The lists are created as Markdown tables. You can write anything in the status
column, and it will be preserved when you update the list.
