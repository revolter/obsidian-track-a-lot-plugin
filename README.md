# Track-a-Lot Plugin

This is a tracker plugin for Obsidian (https://obsidian.md).

It scrapes different webpages, builds Markdown tables with the information, and allows you to
manually track them using a status column.

You can write anything in the status column, and it will be preserved when you update the list.
